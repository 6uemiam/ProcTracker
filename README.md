# Proc Tracker
## World of Warcraft Addon

Proc Tracker tracks mage's (for now) proc-like spells, such as Fingers of Frost, for all three specializations.

It displays the spells in an informative and clear way which consists of the spell's name, spell's icon and a progress bar.

The entire frame is movable to anywhere in the screen.

The frame of the addon can hold up to five different spells. The order of the spells is ranked by their expiration time.

Here is the list of proc-like spells that can be tracked:

Mage:

Frost: Brain Freeze, Fingers of Frost

Fire: Heating up, Pyroblast!

Arcane: Arcane Charge, Arcane Missiles

More is coming...
